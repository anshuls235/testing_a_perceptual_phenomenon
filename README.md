# testing_a_perceptual_phenomenon
In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color that is not denoted by the name (e.g., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color.

In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect(explained above). I learnt a little bit about the experiment, created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then went through the task myself. I then looked at some data collected from others who had performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted my results in terms of my hypotheses.
